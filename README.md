# Inclined-fish-characteristic-measurement-U-Net-Roctation-correction
#### If you want to get the public dataset, please go to [[link](https://github.com/YuChuang1205/Fish-pure-background-dataset)]  
### If you want to reproduce the paper, you need to understand the following information.
**1.file information**  
The "U_net" folder is used to train the U-net network model and test the images of the test set to generate binary images.  
The "Roctation_correction" folder is used to rotate and correct the binary image generated by the test set test, and then use the external rectangle to output the feature value of the fish body.  



In "U_net" folder:  
"model.py" is the Improve U-net structure;  
"data.py" is some processing functions;  
"main_train.py" is the file for training the model;  
"main_test.py" is the file for testing the model;  

In "Roctation_correction" folder：
“demo.py” is the main program of rotation correction

**2.Create a "data" folder**  
In "U_net" folder, Create a "data" folder, and its sub-directory structure is as follows:
>data

>>aug

>>test    
>>> xx.jpg    
>>>   ...    
>>>  xx.jpg

>>test_results 

>>train   
>>> xx.jpg    
>>>   ...    
>>>  xx.jpg

>>train_mask
>>> xx.png    
>>>   ...    
>>>  xx.png  
 
In "U_net" folder, Create a empty "logs" folder.

In "Roctation_correction" folder, Create "input" folder and "output" folder, and they sub-directory structure is as follows:
>input

>>image    
>>> xx.jpg    
>>>   ...  
>>>  xx.jpg

>>mask  
>>> xx.png    
>>>   ...    
>>>  xx.png  

>output

>>image

>>mask
